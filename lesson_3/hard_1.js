/*
Question 1
Will the following functions return the same results?
function first() {
  return {
    prop1: "hi there"
  };
}
function second() {
  return
  {
    prop1: "hi there"
  };
}
console.log(first());
console.log(second());

No, the first function returns "hi there" while the second one returns undefined. This is because javascript automatically inserts a semi colon after the return keyword in the second function.

/*
Question 2
What does the last line in the following code output?
let object = { first: [1] };
let numArray = object["first"];
numArray.push(2);
console.log(numArray); //  => "[1, 2]"
console.log(object);

Output = { first: [1, 2] }

/*
Question 4
Ben was tasked to write a simple JavaScript function to determine whether an input string is an IP address using 4 dot-separated numbers, e.g., 10.4.5.11. 
He is not familiar with regular expressions.
Alyssa supplied Ben with a function named isAnIpNumber. 
It determines whether a string is a numeric string between 0 and 255 as required for IP numbers and asked Ben to use it. 
Here's the code that Ben wrote:

function isDotSeparatedIpAddress(inputString) {
  let dotSeparatedWords = inputString.split(".");
  while (dotSeparatedWords.length > 0) {
    let word = dotSeparatedWords.pop();
    if (!isAnIpNumber(word)) {
      break;
    }
  }

  return true;
}
Alyssa reviewed Ben's code and said, "It's a good start, but you missed a few things. 
You're not returning a false condition, and you're not handling the case when the input string has more or less than 4 components, e.g., 4.5.5 or 1.2.3.4.5: both those values should be invalid."
Help Ben fix his code.
