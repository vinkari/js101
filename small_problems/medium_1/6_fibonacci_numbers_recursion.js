/*
The Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers in which each number is the sum of the previous two numbers. 
The first two Fibonacci numbers are 1 and 1. 
The third number is 1 + 1 = 2, the fourth is 1 + 2 = 3, the fifth is 2 + 3 = 5, and so on.
This simple sequence can be computed using a recursive function. A recursive function is one in which the function calls itself.
A good recursive function has three primary qualities:
- It calls itself at least once.
- It has an ending condition — e.g., if (num === 1), in the sum function above.
- The results of each recursion are used in each step — e.g., num + sum(num - 1) uses sum(num - 1).
Write a recursive function that computes the nth Fibonacci number, where nth is an argument passed to the function.

  if ( num <= 2) {
    return 1;
  }
  return fibonacci(num - 1) + fibonacci(num - 2);

//Test

console.log(fibonacci(5));       // 5
console.log(fibonacci(12));      // 144
